about what they teach and it clearly shows with each dance class. I love and appreciate the staff because they are welcoming and amazingly organized.

<p>Ballet is the fundamental of dance technique as it develops grace, flexibility, strength and balance. We recommend taking Ballet by itself or as an added fundamental class weekly to support any other dance style like Jazz, Tap or Hip Hop, even gymnastics and ice skating.&nbsp; Ballet students at this age are required to wear appropriate attire (black leotard, pink tights with any color optional skirt and wear their hair in a clean bun).</p>

<p>Jazz is an energetic class that focuses on core strength, flexibility, and technique. It&rsquo;s Ballet based, so it has a lot of the same fundamentals as Ballet, but Jazz is high energy and fast paced! Your child will work on turns, leaps and will learn a number of new routines to fun songs ranging from pop to show tunes.</p>
<p><strong>Jumps &amp; Turns</strong>&nbsp; Think of this class as a Jazz class boot camp! It is filled with technical exercises for the dancer who wants to increase strength, flexibility and dance technique. It is to be taken with a Jazz class.</p>

<p>Tap is a great way to exercise the body as well as the mind! It challenges students to integrate rhythmic patterns using their feet as the instrument. Tap focuses on beat, timing, rhythm and coordination. As students become more advanced they will learn increasingly intricate combinations. Keep in mind, a one hour tap class requires a great deal of coordination and can be challenging to those under 9 years old, unless they have had previous dance experience.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> </strong></span></p>
<hr />
<p><strong> <br />Why is dance important? </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First and foremost, dance is important because it&rsquo;s fun! Our teachers are dancers themselves   and share their passion with their students. Additionally, the National Dance Education   Organization says that dance trains a better combination of flexibility, strength, endurance, and   coordination than most other physical pursuits. But beyond that, educators are increasingly   recognizing the importance of the arts on cognitive development. Creative and aesthetic   pursuits like dance have been repeatedly linked to improved physical, mental, and social   well being, as well as academic achievement. More than ever, dance and the arts are <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/ken_robinson_says_schools_kill_creativity.html" target="_blank">being   recognized as essential pieces of a complete education</a> by leading teachers, administrators, and   educational philosophers.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Why start dance lessons now?</strong></span></p>
<p>Whether your child has been dancing for years or has never taken a class before, early primary   age is a great time to start. At 6-9 year old, kids are developing the motor skills and awareness to tackle   all the basics (and then some) to many formal dance styles. Pediatricians, NGOs, and other   child health experts the world over laud the physical, mental, and social benefits of dance for   children. Plus, at this age kids are more able than most adults to learn new things quickly.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Why Ballet? </strong></span></p>
<p>While there are many different styles of dance, Ballet is a cornerstone of most formal dance   instruction. Ballet teaches strength, balance, flexibility, coordination, and movement skills which   are the foundation from everything from Hip Hop to Salsa. It&rsquo;s also an excellent form of exercise   and fosters both discipline and community building among students (all reasons <a href="http://cedance.wordpress.com/2012/12/12/ballet/" target="_blank">Columbus State   University</a> gives for teaching kids Ballet). In this age range, classes are all about mastering the   fundamentals. Our teachers cultivate a love of Ballet and dance while working with students to   perfect age-appropriate techniques.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Why Jazz? </strong></span></p>
<p>Thanks to shows like <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9EoPqHA65s" target="_blank"><em>Dancing with the Stars</em></a>, interest in Jazz dancing is peaking right now. Jazz   combines some of the rigors of Ballet training with more free-form expressionism, making it not   only an exciting and accessible form to watch and dance, but also an essential to any student   with an interest in musical theater or <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAUZIw95ueM" target="_blank">show choir</a>.</p>
<p>Jazz is a uniquely American style which reflects the diversity of the United States&rsquo; immigrant   heritage. Both the music and the dance style mix strong African heritage with European   influences. It&rsquo;s also a wide-ranging style of dance, and can encompass everything from the   Charleston and swing to more modern dance steps. Jazz is a great way for both kids who are   serious about dance and those who just want to learn to move in exciting new ways have fun   expressing themselves to many different types of music.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Why Tap?</strong></span></p>
<p>If your child is caught between taking dance classes or music lessons, Tap might be the answer.   Tap is the most musical and rhythmically precise of all the styles of dance we teach. Tap   develops complex motor skills, coordination, a sense of rhythm, and cardiovascular strength, all   of which are important developmentally whether your child wants to become a dancer or not.   The American Council on Exercise says Tap is a great activity for both the young and old because   it easily modulates to any fitness level, meaning it&rsquo;s easy to learn the basics, but also easy to   progress. There&rsquo;s also a <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/9159802/Music-helps-children-learn-maths.html" target="_blank">strong connection</a> between the rhythmic musicality that is core to Tap   dance and improved mathematical understanding.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Why Hip Hop? </strong></span></p>
<p>Kids like to move. So do we! Hip-hop is exciting, active, and expressive, and your kid will love it   for all of those reasons. But you&rsquo;ll also love it because it&rsquo;s fast becoming one of the best ways for   kids to stay active and grow up strong.Hip hop encourages kids to move their entire body and   get comfortable within their own skin, both physically and socially.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Why should we choose a particular style of dance? </strong></span></p>
<p>The National Dance Education Organization lists the following as reasons to learn standardized   dance forms:</p>
<ul>
<li>Provide a scaffold outlining the breadth and scope of learning and teaching dance   as an art upon which to design curricula and course syllabi. Standards are a guide,   not a directive nor a curriculum. They offer constructive support, suggesting areas of   curriculum but not defining it. Standards allow each district or school to develop an   approach most suited to local or individual values.</li>
<li>Serve as a springboard for creativity for the learning and teaching of dance making:   improvisation, choreography, and composition. Standards suggest avenues of creative   exploration in the arts-making processes of Performing, Creating, Responding to, and   interconnecting dance learning to knowledge of other disciplines and life skills.</li>
<li>Define age-appropriate expectations and levels of achievement in the art of   dance. Standards inform individual schools of dance and school districts what students   should know and be able to do in the art of dance at certain benchmark levels when   taught by a highly qualified dance teacher in a graduated curriculum. </li>
</ul>
<p>None of that means students can&rsquo;t learn more than one style (many of our students do, and we   think that&rsquo;s great!) or create their own styles out of elements of others, but when learning to   dance, it&rsquo;s helpful to have an established standard to learn from.</p>
