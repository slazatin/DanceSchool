about what they teach and it clearly shows with each dance class. I love and appreciate the staff because they are welcoming and amazingly organized.

<p>Ballet is the fundamental of dance technique as it develops grace, flexibility, strength and balance. We recommend taking Ballet by itself or as an added fundamental class weekly to support any other dance style like Jazz, Tap or Hip Hop, even gymnastics and ice skating.&nbsp; Ballet students at this age are required to wear appropriate attire (black leotard, pink tights with any color optional skirt and wear their hair in a clean bun).</p>

You will work on turns, leaps and will learn a number of routines to fun songs ranging from Broadway, pop &amp; contemporary styles.</p>
<p><strong>Jumps &amp; Turns</strong>&nbsp; Think of this class as a Jazz  class  boot camp! It is filled with technical exercises for the dancer  who  wants to increase strength, flexibility and dance technique. It is  to be  taken with a Jazz class.</p>

<p>Tap is a great way to exercise the body as well as the mind! It challenges students to integrate rhythmic patterns using their feet as the instrument. Tap focuses on beat, timing, rhythm and coordination. As students become more advanced they will learn increasingly intricate combinations. Keep in mind, a one hour tap class requires a great deal of coordination and can be challenging to those under 9 years old, unless they have had previous dance experience.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Why is dance important? </strong></span></p>
<p>First and foremost, dance is important because it&rsquo;s fun! Our teachers are dancers themselves   and share their passion with their students. Additionally, the National Dance Education   Organization says that dance trains a better combination of flexibility, strength, endurance, and   coordination than most other physical pursuits. But beyond that, educators are increasingly   recognizing the importance of the arts on cognitive development. Creative and aesthetic   pursuits like dance have been repeatedly linked to improved physical, mental, and social   well being, as well as academic achievement. More than ever, dance and the arts are <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/ken_robinson_says_schools_kill_creativity.html" target="_blank">being   recognized as essential pieces of a complete education</a> by leading teachers, administrators, and   educational philosophers.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Ballet for Teens </strong></span></p>
<p>Ballet is a cornerstone of most formal dance instruction, and teaches the strength, balance,   flexibility, coordination, and movement skills which are the foundation from everything from Hip Hop to Salsa. But whether you&rsquo;re just starting out at Ballet or you&rsquo;ve been practicing since   you were little, whether you want to pursue a career as a dancer or just want to learn what all   the fuss is about, Dance Magazine says the teen years are key. &ldquo;It takes about 12 years to produce a   company-ready [professional] dancer,&rdquo; says Damara Bennett, director of the School of Oregon   Ballet Theatre, and the teen years account for the majority of that training. But that shouldn&rsquo;t   discourage newcomers from trying Ballet, even newcomers with professional dance aspirations.   Patience and a willingness to learn from the beginning are very important. No matter who you   are, though, the desire to have fun through dance is key!</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Jazz for Teens </strong></span></p>
<p>Thanks to shows like <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9EoPqHA65s" target="_blank"><em>Dancing with the Stars</em></a>, interest in Jazz dancing is peaking right now. Jazz   combines some of the rigors of Ballet training with more free-form expressionism, making it not   only an exciting and accessible form to watch and dance, but also an essential to any student   with an interest in musical theater or <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAUZIw95ueM" target="_blank">show choir</a>.   Jazz is a uniquely American style which reflects the diversity of the United States&rsquo; immigrant   heritage. Both the music and the dance style mix strong African heritage with European   influences. It&rsquo;s also a wide-ranging style of dance, and can encompass everything from the   Charleston and swing to more modern dance steps. Jazz is a great way to learn to move in a   variety of ways to many different types of music, both for the serious dancer and newcomers   just looking to have fun learning some steps.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Hip Hop for Teens </strong></span></p>
<p>Hip Hop is one of the most popular dance forms today, and many modern songs in pop music,   rock, rap, and R&amp;B are based on elements of Hip Hop. Hip Hop encourages kids to move their   entire body and get comfortable within their own skin, both physically and socially. It&rsquo;s a free-form, improvisational style that is fun for anybody to learn, and can also be important to the   serious dance student, especially students interested in modern dance.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Tap for Teens </strong></span></p>
<p>If your child is caught between taking dance classes or music lessons, Tap might be the answer.   Tap is the most musical and rhythmically precise of all the styles of dance we teach. Tap   develops complex motor skills, coordination, a sense of rhythm, and cardiovascular strength, all   of which are important developmentally whether your child wants to become a dancer or not.   The American Council on Exercise says Tap is a great activity for both the young and old because   it easily modulates to any fitness level, meaning it&rsquo;s easy to learn the basics, but also easy to   progress. There&rsquo;s also a <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/9159802/Music-helps-children-learn-maths.html" target="_blank">strong connection</a> between the rhythmic musicality that is core to Tap   dance and improved mathematical understanding.  Our classes range from new dancers to established Tap dancers with professional aspirations,   and Tap routines vary widely from <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAB12aeI6nA" target="_blank">the classical</a> to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S3VAd3qRWHU" target="_blank">the contemporary</a>!</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Why Take Adult Dance Classes? </strong></span></p>
<p>Maybe you danced growing up and just want to get back in the studio. Maybe you&rsquo;ve never   stopped, and want to keep improving your skills. Maybe you&rsquo;ve never set foot in a dance studio   in your life but have decided now is the time to learn what dance is all about. Our adult dance   classes span the lot.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Ballet for Adults </strong></span></p>
<p>Ballet is a cornerstone of most formal dance instruction, and teaches the strength, balance,   flexibility, coordination, and movement skills which are the foundation from everything from Hip Hop to Salsa. Proficiency at Ballet takes years of practice, so if you&rsquo;re just starting, patience   and a willingness to learn from the beginning are key, but the rewards can be huge. Ballerina   and fitness expert Mary Helen Bowers, who worked with actress Natalie Portman to prepare   for her starring role in Black Swan, says dance is a great way to maintain fitness, in many ways   better than popular alternatives like yoga. "In yoga,&rdquo; she says, &ldquo;you hold the positions, whereas   in dance, you're constantly moving, extending, reaching through the legs and arms, which helps   build long, lean muscles as opposed to shorter, tighter ones."</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Jazz for Adults </strong></span></p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve been watching <em>Dancing with the Stars</em> or <em>So You Think You Can Dance</em> and thought it looked like fun, Jazz dance classes might be the place to start. Jazz combines attention to   technique with more free-form expressionism, making it an exciting, accessible, and versatile   form to watch and dance. If you had fun with musical theater or <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAUZIw95ueM" target="_blank">show choir</a> in high school or   college, one of our more advanced adult classes might be the perfect place for you to jump back   into it.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Hip Hop for Adults </strong></span></p>
<p>Hip Hop is one of the most popular dance forms today, and many modern songs in pop music,   rock, rap, and R&amp;B are based on elements of Hip Hop. Feeling out of place at the dance club? Hip Hop classes are a great way to learn how to move to a beat and fit in on the dance floor. Hip Hop is a free-form, improvisational style that is fun for anybody to learn, and is also an essential   component of modern dance.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Tap for Adults </strong></span></p>
<p>The American Council on Exercise says Tap is a great activity for both the young and old because   it easily modulates to any fitness level, meaning it&rsquo;s easy to learn the basics, but also easy to   progress. Tap routines vary widely from <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAB12aeI6nA" target="_blank">the classical</a> to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S3VAd3qRWHU" target="_blank">the contemporary</a>, and Tap lessons are a   great way to keep your body healthy and get comfortable moving in rhythm.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Why choose a particular style of dance? </strong></span></p>
<p>The National Dance Education Organization lists the following as reasons to learn standardized   dance forms:</p>
<ul>
<li>Provide a scaffold outlining the breadth and scope of learning and teaching dance   as an art upon which to design curricula and course syllabi. Standards are a guide,   not a directive nor a curriculum. They offer constructive support, suggesting areas of   curriculum but not defining it. Standards allow each district or school to develop an   approach most suited to local or individual values.</li>
<li>Serve as a springboard for creativity for the learning and teaching of dance making:   improvisation, choreography, and composition. Standards suggest avenues of creative   exploration in the arts-making processes of Performing, Creating, Responding to, and   interconnecting dance learning to knowledge of other disciplines and life skills.</li>
<li>Define age-appropriate expectations and levels of achievement in the art of  dance. Standards inform individual schools of dance and school districts what students   should know and be able to do in the art of dance at certain benchmark levels when   taught by a highly qualified dance teacher in a graduated curriculum. </li>
</ul>
<p>None of that means students can&rsquo;t learn more than one style (many of our students do, and we   think that&rsquo;s great!) or create their own styles out of elements of others, but when learning to   dance, it&rsquo;s helpful to have an established standard to learn from.</p>
