<p>My daughter has been taking various dance lessons here since they opened.  She loves the instructors who are all awesome and great with the kids. Every summer, they have dance recitals which is wonderfully organized and coordinated.  All details are professionally executed, from the costumes, to the pictures, lighting, everything.  It's a great show. Santa Monica School of Dance and Music rocks!</p>

<p>The dance instructors are really amazing with children!  They have so much positive energy and are even amazing with children that are slower to warm up.  Additionally, they have a ton of classes throughout the week and are extremely flexible with make ups.  Everyone goes out of their way to be friendly and accommodating.  Overall it's been a really great experience!</p>

<p>The classes are smaller than other dance studios, so there is more opportunity for one on one instruction. They also offer unlimited make up classes, which is great. They are very flexible and always work with our schedule! I have recommended this studio to many of my friends with kids and would recommend it anyone who is looking for a dance studio. This studio is definitely the best dance and music school in Santa Monica!</p>

<p>If most dance studios seem to have qualified, friendly teachers, experience teaching children and a big show at the end of the year, aren&rsquo;t they all pretty much the same? Does it really matter at which place you decide to enroll? Yes! There are 5 main things that can make a huge difference in the quality of instruction your child receives, the amount of extra work and hassles the parents must deal with and the overall enjoyment and satisfaction of being involved with a dance program. Here are 5 things that every parent should consider before deciding on a dance studio for their child...</p>
<h3>What Type Of Floor Is Used?</h3>
<p>Dance is a very physical activity that requires a lot of jumping, which can put stress on bones and joints. Most dance footwear does not provide any cushioning or support, so the shock of dance movement can place a lot of pressure on the knees and back of a dancer. The best way to prevent against potential injury is by choosing a studio with a professional &ldquo;floating floor&rdquo;. A floating floor is a dance floor that rests on a system of high-density foam, to absorb the shock of jumping. A high-density foam base is superior to a &ldquo;sprung&rdquo; floor, which usually consists of a wood structure built on the regular floor.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="../images/dance-floor.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>The top layer of the dance floor is also an important factor. A vinyl composite &ldquo;marley&rdquo; floor is accepted worldwide as the best surface layer for recreational to professional dance. Facilities such as the Royal Winnipeg Ballet, the Royal Academy of Dance in London, England, and Riverdance - The Touring Show, all use marley floors as their dance surface. A marley floor allows dancers to slide, with a degree of &ldquo;controlled slip", but is not slippery so there is less risk of slips and falls. Very few studios use professional marley floors because of the expense involved, and usually opt for a regular floor tile for a studio floor.</p>
<p>All of our studio locations have floating floors that have over 700 high density foam blocks under the floor surface and a marley top surface that is imported from England. Our special floors help reduce the risk of injuries and allow students to dance longer without getting tired.</p>
<h3>What Is The Size Of The Class?</h3>
<p>If the dance class has fewer students in it each child will receive more personalized attention, learn more and have more fun. With younger students it is easier for a teacher to maintain control over the class and make sure each student understands the concepts and instructions. Our smaller class sizes make sure that no fundamental concepts are being missed. A smaller class size also allows our teachers to ensure that students are not developing bad habits or improper technique.</p>
<p>For preschool dance, our studio limits classes for (ages 1&frac12; - 3) to a maximum of just 6 students per class, and for (ages 4 - 6)&nbsp;we limit Ballet classes to a maximum of just 10 students per class, and Hip Hop Jr. to a maximum of 10 per class. &nbsp;All of our dance classes (ages 6 &amp; up) we limit to a maximum of just 10 students per class.</p>
<h3>What Are The Extras Required For The Year End Show?</h3>
<p>Most studios put on a year end show in a professional theatre. Students that perform in the show must have a costume for their dance number. Some studios may require parents to sew their child&rsquo;s costumes, or pay extra and the parents must find their own seamstress to do any alterations. This can be inconvenient and frustrating for parents who are busy or can&rsquo;t sew.</p>
<p>Our studios use our own professional seamstress to sew and alter the costumes, so parents do not have to worry about any costume hassles.</p>
<h3>Is There a Well-Designed Curriculum in Place?</h3>
<p>Dance is a very technical form of art. A well-designed curriculum should both challenge and inspire the beginner to the most seasoned dancer. This balance between a challenging yet inspiring program must contain proper technique, sequence and terminology at all levels. The mixture of fun, creativity, energy, and the proper music are also big factors when determining if a program has been designed for optimal learning and enjoyment.</p>
<p>Our class schedule offers a broad range of popular and traditional dance forms for all ages (1&frac12; &amp; up) and all levels. Our school has a specific curriculum designed to create and capture a student&rsquo;s enthusiasm while emphasizing proper technique, sequence and terminology.</p>
<p>We also provide the opportunity for our dancers to excel beyond recreational level. Our Dance Company is a vehicle through which a dancer can participate in performances throughout the year.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Can I Get Immediate Assistance And Customer Service?</h3>
<p>In many studios, the teacher or the studio owner conducts classes and does the administration. By trying to do two jobs at once, the class may suffer as the teacher has to use class time for customer service issues, or the studio may have no customer service available if the teacher is in a class. To have a good experience it is important to choose a studio that can assist you with details like costumes or schedules, even if a teacher is occupied in a class. Our studios have office staff on hand during all regular class times, so you can get immediate assistance.</p>
<p class="red">Ask any dance school, dance studio or ballet academy in the Sherman Oaks, Studio City, Encino, or San Fernando Valley area these questions and you will see why more families choose our studio each year than any other. After browsing this site please call us with any questions you may have about getting the most out of your dance experience.</p>
